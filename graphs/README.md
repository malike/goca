Traversing is travel or visit. There are two ways of vising the nodes
of a graph Breadth First(BFT) and Depth First(DFT).

#### Breadth First Traversal [BFT]

***i. Description***

This is a way of traversing graphs where you visit a node and all it's children before moving
to the next level of neighbours. This means other nodes at the same level of the inital node visited.

With the aid of a **queue** we build the nodes that need to be visited in order and using the FIFO foundation of queues
we visit the nodes in order.

Note that this can also be used for search. This is known as **Breadth First Search**.
